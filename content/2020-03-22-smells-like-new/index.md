Hello there!

Eloi here. Before you ask - yes, I am in surplus of free time due to this COVID-19 worldwide quarantine, and it looks like I will be trying to spend some quality, one-on-one time with my personal website.

However, I promise not to focus my energy on the causes behind this excess of free time and, instead, work on sharing some of the work I have left halfway done on some of my personal projects.

Stay tuned for more updates.
