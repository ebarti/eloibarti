          Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
        </h3>
        <p>
          My name is <b>Eloi Barti Tremoleda</b>, and I am a senior lead software engineer based in Barcelona, Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do a bit of everything. Fullstack? Hmmm... not sure, although I've built this website myself ðŸ˜Š. Personal preference? Backend!
        </p>
        <p>
          I lead the Platform Security team at Glovo, within the Cyber-security department of Engineering.
          In my current job I am both an Individual Contributor (IC) and an Engineering Manager (EM):
          I manage the performance of my direct reports (as well as performing all the EM-related chores) while
          being a key contributor of the Cyber-security cluster.
